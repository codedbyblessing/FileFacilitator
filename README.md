# FileFacilitator

This project is in progress, and I am open to any feedback.
My goal is to get an understanding of how this can be improved.
I need to enhance code to request macOS for logging permissions in the terminal
The stretch goal is to turn this into a software secured by a cloud to ensure security for user files
